               <h2 id="heading_font">Pt. 1: St. Louis, MO</h2>
               <p>This is where it all started for Steve. 1986. Born and 
                raised in St. Louis, Missouri he was an only child to Jane and Steve. 
                He grew up in Affton, a part of South County and primarily attended 
                St. George gradeschool. Went to SLUH, or St. Louis University Highschool 
                where one of his favorite classes was Web Design, freshman year. Sophmore 
                year Steve attempted to learn Java and it was TOO much with all the other
                classes. The class was dropped and unfortunately programming 
                became an afterthought. </p>

                <h2 id="heading_font">Pt. 2: College</h2>
                <p>Not wanting to be stuck in St. Louis or head to Mizzou, where
                    everyone goes, Steve made a break for it. Decided to head to Lawrence, 
                    Kansas for 2 years at University of Kansas and eventually transfer to 
                    Long Beach, California to attend CSULB (California State University Long 
                    Beach). As he worked towards his Bachelor of Arts degree, in those 4 years, 
                    Steve joined a fraternity, drove across the United States, interned at Jimmy Kimmel 
                    Live! and Cartoon Network.

                    <h2 id="heading_font">Pt. 3: Reality</h2>
                    <p>The intention was to get a job in the entertainment industry 
                        right out of college. Not the reality of Steve. Graduating in 
                        2009 was not the best experience. Steve had to make the decision to 
                        head back home to St. Louis with hopes of making it out to California 
                        again in the future, to chase the dream. Living back home with Mom only 
                        lasted 3 months before heading to Kansas City to live up there with friends. 
                        Jobs included pizza delivery, manager, and eventually sales and compliance 
                        in a corporate setting. Unhappy, Steve headed back to St. Louis deciding to 
                        try and do a reset once more. 4 years passed with lots of video games, weed, and 
                        the best thing to come into his life, Bear, his dog and best bud.

                        <h2 id="heading_font">Pt. 4: Back to STL</h2>
                        <p>Steve's hope was to move back home with his father and not only help
                            himself, but be there for his father. It was not where Steve needed 
                            to be. A depression set in about what the future held, but knowing he 
                            had Bear, he was able to get through the tough times of struggling to 
                            find the right job. Two and a half long years passed until things changed
                            for the better.

                        <p>Spring 2017 I was hired at Square. Another corporate environment,
                            but one I felt at home in. Customer Support was where I started 
                            and have worked my way to become a Chatbot Specialist. Not only that, 
                            but I was introduced to programming again with LaunchCode. 15 years have
                            passed since I dropped programming in highschool. Now I am back at it and
                            ready to see what the future holds.
